# SQL Analytical Project Report

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project is based on a **movie rental database** containing multiple entities:  
- **Movies**  
- **Actors**  

- **ActsIn (relation between movies and actors)**  
- **Customers**  
- **Renting (transactions of rentals)**  

The purpose of this analysis is to generate business insights using **SQL queries**, such as:  
- Customer behavior  
- Movie popularity  
- Revenue generation  
- Actor involvement
